## Lecture 2: Prime Factorization and Greatest Common divisors
#### Fundamental theorem of arithmetics
Every positive integer $n$ has a unique prime factorization.
$$n=p_1^{n_1}p_2^{n_2}\cdots p_k^{n_k}$$

**Proof** First we prove the existence. If $n$ is a prime, then $n=n$. If $n$ is a composite number, then $n=n_1n_2$. We can continue the process on $n_1$ and $n_2$ until we get a prime fractorization. 

Second, we prove the uniqueness. If there are two factorizations, $$n=p_1^{n_1}p_2^{n_2}\cdots p_k^{n_k}=q_1^{m_1}q_2^{m_2}\cdots q_l^{m_l}$$
Since $p_1$ is a factor of the right hand side, $p_1$ must equal to some $q_i$. Now dividing both sides on $p_1$ to get a smaller product. So it reduces to prove uniqueness for smaller $n$. Now we may repeat such argument to prove the uniquenss. QED.

**Example** 
* $420=10\cdot42=(2\cdot5)\cdot(2\cdot3\cdot7)=2^2\cdot3\cdot5\cdot7$
* $729=9^3$
* $181=?$ not trivial, so it may be a prime. suffices to divide prime numbers up to $13$. 

#### Perfect squares
Perfect squares are of the form $n^2$. Its prime factorization has all even powers. 

**Example**
* $2^{10}\cdot3^6\cdot 7^{30}=(2^5)^2(3^3)^2(7^{15})^2$

It is useful to memorize them checking a number is prime of not. Below is the list of squares of numbers from 1 to 30, split into three columns:

| **1 to 10 Squares** | **11 to 20 Squares** | **21 to 30 Squares** |
|---------------------|----------------------|----------------------|
| \( 1^2 = 1 \)       | \( 11^2 = 121 \)     | \( 21^2 = 441 \)     |
| \( 2^2 = 4 \)       | \( 12^2 = 144 \)     | \( 22^2 = 484 \)     |
| \( 3^2 = 9 \)       | \( 13^2 = 169 \)     | \( 23^2 = 529 \)     |
| \( 4^2 = 16 \)      | \( 14^2 = 196 \)     | \( 24^2 = 576 \)     |
| \( 5^2 = 25 \)      | \( 15^2 = 225 \)     | \( 25^2 = 625 \)     |
| \( 6^2 = 36 \)      | \( 16^2 = 256 \)     | \( 26^2 = 676 \)     |
| \( 7^2 = 49 \)      | \( 17^2 = 289 \)     | \( 27^2 = 729 \)     |
| \( 8^2 = 64 \)      | \( 18^2 = 324 \)     | \( 28^2 = 784 \)     |
| \( 9^2 = 81 \)      | \( 19^2 = 361 \)     | \( 29^2 = 841 \)     |
| \( 10^2 = 100 \)    | \( 20^2 = 400 \)     | \( 30^2 = 900 \)     |

#### Factor counting formula
If $n=p_1^{n_1}p_2^{n_2}\cdots p_k^{n_k}$, then the number of factors are $$(n_1+1)(n_2+1)\cdots(n_k+1).$$

**Example** 
* $n=p^a$ has $a+1$ factors: $1=p^0,p=p^1,p^2,...,p^a$
* $n=p_1^ap_2^b$ has $(a+1)(b+1)$ factors.

#### Product of factors
Factors usually come in pairs, $n=a\cdot (n/a)$. For example, 
* $42=1*42=2*21=3*14=7*6$
* $169=1*169=13^2$. 

So the product of all factors of $n$ is $n^{\frac{\# \text{factors}}{2}}$. The number of factors is even if and only if $n$ is a perfect square.

#### Sum of factors
The factors of $20=2^2\cdot 7$ are 
* $1=2^0, 2=2^1, 4=2^2$
* $7=2^0\cdot 7, 14=2^1\cdot 7, 28=2^2\cdot 7$

Their sum equals $(1+2+4)(1+7)=56$. This generalizes to all cases. If $n=p_1^{n_1}p_2^{n_2}\cdots p_k^{n_k}$, then the sum of factors are 
$$(1+p_1+p_1^2+\cdots+p_1^{n_1})\cdots(1+p_k+p_k^2+\cdots +p_k^{n_k})$$ 

If the sum of factors equals the number itself, we call it a **perfect number**. The first two are $6$ and $28$. 

**Homework** Use ChatGPT to understand the relation between perfect numbers and Mersenne primes.

#### Class activity
Any prime number is either $2$ or an odd prime number. 
**Theorem** Any odd prime number of the form $4k+1$ is a sum of two squares. 
* very difficult, need college math

**Theorem**  Any odd prime number of the form $4k+3$ is not a sum of two squares.

* relatively easy, proved in later lectures
