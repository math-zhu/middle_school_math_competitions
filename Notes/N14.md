## Lecture 13: Solving equations via algebra II

### Reminder on Cramer's rules 
Now let me introduce some college math with the complete solutions for above two equations for two unknowns. We use a,b,c,d,e,f below as 6 given numbers. 
$$
\begin{aligned}
a x + b y &= e \\
c x + d y &= f
\end{aligned}
$$

To solve $x$ and $y$, Cramer's rule has the formula below.
$$
x = \frac{
\begin{vmatrix}
e & b \\
f & d
\end{vmatrix}
}{
\begin{vmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{vmatrix}
},
\quad
y = \frac{
\begin{vmatrix}
a & e \\
c & f
\end{vmatrix}
}{
\begin{vmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{vmatrix}
}
$$

We introduce the determinant symbol

$$\begin{vmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{vmatrix}=ad-bc$$

The way to remember is to start with the coefficient matrix in the demonimator. 
$$
\begin{pmatrix}
a &b\\
c& d
\end{pmatrix}
$$

The first column is called $x$ coefficient column and the second is called $y$ coefficient column. The denominator is always the determinant of the coefficient matrix.

If you want to solve for $x$ then swap the $x$-column with the value column. Similarly if you want to solve for $y$, swap $y$ column with the value column. 

$$
\begin{pmatrix}
e \\
f
\end{pmatrix}
$$

### Examples
* (Speed=Distance/Time) Up hills speed $6$ miles/hour (mph), Down hills spped $18$ miles/hour. If up hill takes $30$ mins, what is the average speed?

    * $d=v*t$. So the one way distance is $6*0.5=3$ miles.
    * average speed is the total distance over total time. 
        * Uphill takes $0.5$ hour
        * Downhill takes $t=\frac{d}{v}=3/18=\frac{1}{6}$ hour
        * average speed is $\frac{3+3}{\frac{1}{2}+\frac{1}{6}}=9$ miles per hour

* (Harmonic mean) Same problem as above but drop $30$ mins assumption.

    * let us assume the one way distance is $x$.
    * average speed is 
     $$\frac{2x}{\frac{x}{6}+\frac{x}{18}}=\frac{2x}{\frac{2}{9}x}=9$$
    * In general, the formula is 
$$\frac{2x}{\frac{x}{a}+\frac{x}{b}}=\frac{2}{\frac{1}{a}+\frac{1}{b}}=\frac{2ab}{a+b}$$
this is call the harmonic means of two numbers.

* (Tracking the unit) Seven moles take seven minutes to dig seven holes, how long does eight moles dig eight holes?

    * Output is $7$ holes. So the efficiency of the hole digging is 
    $$\frac{7\text{ holes}}{7 \text{ moles}*7 \text{ }min}=\frac{1}{7} \text{ holes/mole*min}$$
    We can say the digging hole rate is one seventh per mole per min. 
    * Now the rest is easy. 
    $$8 \text{ holes}=\frac{1}{7} \text{ holes/mole*min} * 8 \text{ moles}* x \text{ min}$$
    All units cancelled out and $x=7$ min.

* (Two unknowns and two equations) Three chocalate bars and five lollipops cost 22 and four chocalate bars and two lollipops cost 20. How much does each cost?

> \[
>\begin{array}{rl}
>3x + 5y = 22 & \quad (1) \\
>4x + 2y = 20 & \quad (2)
>\end{array}
>\]

*    * cancellation trick $(1)*4-(2)*3$ we get $y=2$ and $x=4$.

> \[
>\begin{array}{rl}
>12x + 20y = 88 & \quad (1) \\
>12x + 6y = 60 & \quad (2)\\
> 14y=28
>\end{array}
>\]

*   * using Cramer's rule

$$
\begin{vmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{vmatrix}
=\begin{vmatrix}
3 & 5 \\
4 & 2
\end{vmatrix}=6-20=-14
$$

$$
\begin{vmatrix}
e & b \\
f & d
\end{vmatrix}
=\begin{vmatrix}
22 & 5 \\
20 & 2
\end{vmatrix}=44-100=-56
$$

$$
\begin{vmatrix}
a & e \\
c & f
\end{vmatrix}
=\begin{vmatrix}
3 & 22 \\
4 & 20
\end{vmatrix}=60-88=-28
$$
$$
x = \frac{
\begin{vmatrix}
e & b \\
f & d
\end{vmatrix}
}{
\begin{vmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{vmatrix}
}=\frac{-56}{-14}=4,
\quad
y = \frac{
\begin{vmatrix}
a & e \\
c & f
\end{vmatrix}
}{
\begin{vmatrix}
a & b \\
c & d
\end{vmatrix}
}=\frac{-28}{-14}=2
$$


* (Ratio Rule) 
$$\frac{a}{b}=\frac{c}{d}$$
is the same as $ad=bc$

* Jim is twice as his youngest brother's age at 2020. After 20 years, the ratio is $\frac{2}{3}$.

$$\frac{x+20}{2x+20}=\frac{2}{3}$$
$$3x+60=2x+40$$

So $x=10$ and Jim has age $20$ at 2020.
