## Lecture 4: Decimal vs Binary, and more
### A math joke
We have "Thanksgiving = Christmas" because $\text{Dec }25=\text{Oct }31$.

#### Decimal or Base-Ten system
Base-Ten system (decimal numeral system) is mostly used because we have ten fingers. All numbers are expressed by $0,1,\cdots,9$. The base-ten expression has the following expression.
##### Example
$$\begin{align*}
12345&=10000+2000+300+40+5\\
&=1*10^4+2*10^3+3*10^3+4*10^1+5*10^0\\
&=12345_{10}\\
&= \text{Dec } (12345)
\end{align*}$$
##### Base-Two (Binary) system
That is the computer numbering system because computer has know 2 digits $0$ and $1$... You can only use $0$ and $1$ to label a number $0, 1, 10, 11, 100, 101, 110, 111, 1000....$
* $10_2=1*2^1+0*2^0=2_{10}$
* $111_2=1*2^2+1*2^1+1*2^0=7_{10}$
* $10111=1*2^4+111=23_{10}$

##### Base-Three (Ternery) system
You can only use $0,1,2$ to label a number $0,1,2,10,11,12,20,21,22,100,101, 102, 110,...$
* $122_3=1*3^2+2*3^1+2=17$
* $122_3=200_3-1_3=18-1=17$

##### Base-Eight (Octal) system
You can only use $0,...,7$ to label a number $0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,10,....$
* $\text{Oct 31}=31_8=3*8^1+1=25_{10}=\text{Dec 31}$ (the joke)

##### Base-Sixteen (Hexadecimal) system
You can only use $0,...,9, A,B,C,D,E,F$ to label a number $0,1,2,3,4,5,6,7,10,A,B,C,D,E,F,10, 11,....$
* $BB=11*16+11=187_{10}$ 

##### Base-$n$ system
With the proper labels, you can design any base-$n$ system. $n<10$ is easy because we can borrow the ten digits. For $n$ is large, you need to design your own "digit" such as $A,B,C,...$.

#### Convert a decimal to other base
Use long division.
* Convert $25_{10}$ to octal
    * $25=3*8+1$  
    * So $25_{10}=31_8$. The joke again.
* Convert $78_{10}$ to binary
    * **repetitively divides $2$ until you cannot. Collect the last divisor and other remaiders in the reserve way**.
        * 78=2*39+0
        * 39=2*19+1
        * 19=2*9+1
        * 9=2*4+1
        * 4=2*2+0
        * 2=2*1+0
    * $78_{10}=1001110_2=2^6+2^3+2^2+2^1=64+8+4+2=78$ 
* Convert $78_{10}$ to base $3$.
    * $78=3*26+0$
    * $26=3*8+2$
    * $8=3*2+2$
    * So $78_{10}=2220_3$

#### Addition and substraction
Use long addition and substraction!!
* $111_2+11_2=1010_2$
* the above is the same as $7+3=10$.
* $10010_2-1101_2=101_2$
* the above is the same as $18-13=5$.

Long addition/substraction really works for any base! But need to be careful on add/minus one.
* for octals, $7_8+4_8=13_8$
* for binary, only need to remember $1_2+1_2=10_2$ and $10_2-1_2=1_2$

#### Multiplication and division
Use long multiplication and long division!!
**$9*9$ multiplication table for binary**
* $0*0=0$
* $0*1=1*0=0$
* $1*1=1$

Computer likes this because it is really easy!! No need to memorize $9*9$ multiplication table. We can do that too but it is too late.... We get so used to decimal system.

**Homework** Create a base-$5$ $5*5$ multiplication table.

##### Example
work below out use long multiplication/division
* $111_2*11_2=7*3=21$ 
* $1001110_2/110_2=78/6=13=1101_2$

#### Bonus
* We know $1/3=0.33333....$. What is the division in base three?
$$1_3/10_3=0.1_3=0.33333....$$
This extends to all fractions or rational numbers.
* We know $1/2=0.5$. What is the division in base two?
$$1/2=1_2/10_2=0.1$$
* But in base $3$
$$1/2=0.11111....._3=\frac{1}{3}+\frac{1}{3^2}+\frac{1}{3^3}+...$$
* In fact, for any base $n$,
$$\frac{1}{n-1}=0.11111....._n=\frac{1}{n}+\frac{1}{n^2}+\frac{1}{n^3}+...$$
* We know in base $3_{10}=10_3$. But $10_3$ is not a prime!! Because $2$ can not divide $10_3$. Thus a prime number is a prime number for any base.
