## Lecture 6: Arithmetic and geometric series
### Number series
A **number series** is a sequence of numbers.
$$a_1,a_2,a_3,...$$

**Example**
* the natural number series $0,1,2,...$ with the formula $a_n=n-1$
* the perfect square series $0,1,4,9,...$ with the formula $a_n=(n-1)^2$
* the prime number series $2,3,5,7,...$ with no obvious formula
* Fibonacci series $1,1,2,3,5,8,...$ with $a_{n+2}=a_{n}+a_{n+1}$ when $n\ge 1$
* Harmonic series $1,\frac{1}{2}, \frac{1}{3}, \frac{1}{4}, ...$ with the formula $a_n=\frac{1}{n}$
* the $9$ series $0.9, 0.99, 0.999, 0.9999, 0.99999....$ and the limit is $1$.
* the $\pi$ series $3, 3.1, 3.14, 3.141, 3.1415,...$
* the series of positive rational numbers $\frac{1}{1},\frac{1}{2},\frac{2}{1},\frac{1}{3},\frac{2}{3},\frac{3}{2},\frac{3}{1},...$ with numerating all nonrepeating fractions with both numerator and denominator up to $k$
* Check the On-Line Encyclopedia of Integer Sequences (OEIS) ([Link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_integer_sequences)) for more awesome series.

### Arithmetic progression (series)
An arithmetic progression is a number series with equal distance. It has the formula 

$$a_n=a_1+(n-1)d,$$ 

where $a_1$ is the first term and $d$ is the equal distance

**Example**
* $1,3,5,7,9,...$ with $a_n=2n-1$
* $2,4,6,8,10,...$ with $a_n=2n$
* $3,7,11,15,...$ with $a_n=3+4(n-1)$
* in general 
* $3,7,11,...$ what is the 50th term? $a_{50}=3+4*49=199$
* How many terms of a series starting from $3$ and ends at $35$ with equal distance $4$? 
    * $(35-3)/4+1=9$
    * ends at $11$? $(11-3)/4+1=3$

**The sum formula**
The sum of the arithmetic progression has the formula below

$$\sum_{k=1}^n a_k=a_1+a_2+a_3+...+a_n=(a_1+a_n)*n/2,$$

where $n$ is the number of terms which can be calculated by 

$$n=(a_n-a_1)/d+1.$$

**Example**
* $1+2+...+100=(1+100)*100/2=5050$
* $1+3+5+7+...+99=?$
    * the number of terms $n=(99-1)/2+1=50$.
    * the sum $=(1+99)*50/2=50^2=2500$
* $1+3+5+7+...+(2n-1)=(1+2n-1)*n/2=n^2$
* $3+7+11+...+103=?$
    * the number of terms $n=(103-3)/4+1=26$
    * the sum $=(3+103)*26/2=106*13=1378$

### Dirichlet's arithmetic progression theorem

**Theorem** The arithmetic progression of the form $a+bd$:
$$a, a+d, a+2d, a+3d,...$$
has infinitely many prime when $\gcd(a,d)=1$.

**Comments:**
* When $\gcd(a,b)$ is not $1$, we have a series of composite numbers such as 

$$2,12,22,32,...$$

so have at most one prime number. 

* Series like $4k+1$ and $4k+3$ all have infinitely many primes. 

### Geometric series
The geometric series is of the form $a_n=ar^{n-1}$ 

$$a, ar, ar^2, ar^3, ...$$

### The sum formula when $|r|<1$

$$a+ar+ar^2+ar^3+...= a(1+r+r^2+r^3+...)$$

So it suffices to find the value 
$$x=1+r+r^2+r^3+...$$
$$rx=r+r^2+r^3+...=x-1$$
$$1=(1-r)x$$
$$x=\frac{1}{1-r}$$

Thus the sum 

$$a+ar+ar^2+ar^3+...=\frac{a}{1-r}$$

**Example**
* $1+\frac{1}{n}+\frac{1}{n^2}+...=\frac{1}{1-\frac{1}{n}}=\frac{n}{n-1}=1+\frac{1}{n-1}$
    * recall in base $n$, the above is $1.11111..._n=1+0.1111..._n=1+\frac{1}{n-1}$
