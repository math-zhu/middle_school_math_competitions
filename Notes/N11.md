## Lecture 11: Probability and Expectation

**More Examples**:
* A bag of $10$ blocks with $5$ red and $5$ green. What is the probability of picking $5$ with $3$ green and $2$ red?
    * same as selecting committee problem.
    * total outcome $\binom{10}{5}=\frac{10*9*8*7*6}{120}=4*9*7=252$
    * total possibility $\binom{5}{2}*\binom{5}{3}=10*10=100$
    * probability is $\frac{25}{63}$

* Biased coin flipping: A bad coin gives $2/3$ chance of head. What is the probability of getting $3$-heads out of $6$ flips?
    * The possible combinations of "HHHTTT" is $\binom{6}{3}=20$.
    * The probability is actually $20*(\frac{2}{3})^3*(\frac{1}{3})^3$.
    * Notice if the coin is unbiased, then the probability is the same old one. $20/2^6$.

* What is the probability of a triangle being isosceles in an octagon?
    * outcomes: $\binom{8}{3}=56$
    * isosclels outcome: $3*8$

* What is the probability of a group of $n$ student with at least two sharing the same birthday?
    * Use the complementary counting. Check the probability of $n$ students having $n$ different birthdays.
    * we get $$\frac{365}{365}*\frac{364}{365}*\frac{363}{365}*\frac{362}{365}*...*\frac{365-n+1}{365}$$
    * When $n=23$, $P$(at least two sharing same birthday)$>50$%.
    * When $n=70$, $P$(at least two sharing same birthday)$>99$%.
    * counterintuitive, 70 people counts only one fifth of $365$ days but sharing same birthday chance is great than $99$%.

**Geometric probability**:
* A line segment $AB$ with mid point $C$. What is the probability of a point closer to the mid point than to $A$ or $B$?
    * draw the possibility. You find $0.5$.

* A circle embeds into a square. What is the probability in the circle?
    * use area formula
    * If square has length $2$, then square area is $4$ and circle area is $\pi$. 
    * the probability is $\frac{\pi}{4}$.

* A square embeds into a circle. What is the probability in the square?
    * use area formula
    * If circle has radius $2$, then square area is $2$ and circle area is $\pi$. 
    * the probability is $\frac{2}{\pi}$.

* A target with concentric circles with radius from $1$ to $10$. What is the probability in the odd rings?
    * total area: $100\pi$.
    * $k$-th ring: $((k)^2-(k-1)^2)\pi=(2k-1)\pi$
    * $(1+5+9+13+17)\pi/100\pi=45$%

**Expected value (Expectation)**:
* flipping a coin game. You give me one dollar to enter the game. If head, earn $1$ dollar, if tail, nothing. Is this a fair game?
    * the expectation is $0.5*1+0.5*0=0.5$. That is the expected money you expect to earn.
    * but you have to pay $1$ dollar to play. So it is not a fair game.  
    * if you only pay less than $0.5$$, you will earn more money.
    * if you only pay more than $0.5$$, you will lose money.

* Rolling a dice to get same amount of dollar. What is the fair game ticket?
    * $(1+2+3+4+5+6)/6=3.5$


* Gambling machine, claw machineï¼Œpowerball are all designed by expectation analysis. You will always lose in the long term. "Stupidity tax": you buy powerball only when you are stupid.   

* Expectation cannot explain everything.
    * two options: win 50 or half chance win 100 or nothing. Which to pick? 
    * two options: lose 50 or half chance lose 100 or nothing. Which to pick? 

#### Powerball Expectation Analysis: Odds of Winning
The odds of winning each prize are as follows (rounded to the nearest whole number):

- **Jackpot (5 + Powerball)**: 1 in 292,201,338
- **Match 5 (no Powerball)**: 1 in 11,688,053
- **Match 4 + Powerball**: 1 in 913,129
- **Match 4 (no Powerball)**: 1 in 36,525
- **Match 3 + Powerball**: 1 in 14,494
- **Match 3 (no Powerball)**: 1 in 579
- **Match 2 + Powerball**: 1 in 701
- **Match 1 + Powerball**: 1 in 92
- **Powerball only**: 1 in 38

#### Prize Amounts
Here are the prize amounts for each tier, though the actual amounts can vary based on the drawing:

- **Jackpot (5 + Powerball)**: $400,000,000 (typically varies).
- **Match 5 (no Powerball)**: $1,000,000.
- **Match 4 + Powerball**: $50,000.
- **Match 4 (no Powerball)**: $100.
- **Match 3 + Powerball**: $100.
- **Match 3 (no Powerball)**: $7.
- **Match 2 + Powerball**: $7.
- **Match 1 + Powerball**: $4.
- **Powerball only**: $4.

#### Calculating Expected Value

To calculate the expected value, we multiply the probability of winning each prize by the value of the prize and sum the results:

\[
\text{Expected Value} = \sum \left( \frac{\text{Prize}}{\text{Odds of winning the prize}} \right)
\]

#### Step-by-Step Calculation

We will now compute each term:

\[
\text{Expected Value} = \left( \frac{400,000,000}{292,201,338} \right) + \left( \frac{1,000,000}{11,688,053} \right) + \left( \frac{50,000}{913,129} \right) + \left( \frac{100}{36,525} \right) + \left( \frac{100}{14,494} \right) + \left( \frac{7}{579} \right) + \left( \frac{7}{701} \right) + \left( \frac{4}{92} \right) + \left( \frac{4}{38} \right)
\]

#### Results for Each Term

1. \( \frac{400,000,000}{292,201,338} \approx 1.37 \)
2. \( \frac{1,000,000}{11,688,053} \approx 0.0856 \)
3. \( \frac{50,000}{913,129} \approx 0.0548 \)
4. \( \frac{100}{36,525} \approx 0.0027 \)
5. \( \frac{100}{14,494} \approx 0.0069 \)
6. \( \frac{7}{579} \approx 0.0121 \)
7. \( \frac{7}{701} \approx 0.0100 \)
8. \( \frac{4}{92} \approx 0.0435 \)
9. \( \frac{4}{38} \approx 0.1053 \)

#### Sum of All Terms

\[
\text{Expected Value} = 1.37 + 0.0856 + 0.0548 + 0.0027 + 0.0069 + 0.0121 + 0.0100 + 0.0435 + 0.1053 = 1.6899
\]

#### Cost of a Powerball Ticket

A single Powerball ticket costs **$2**.

#### Interpretation

The expected value is about **1.69** per ticket, meaning that, on average, you can expect to win approximately **1.69** for every $2 ticket you purchase. In other words, you are losing about **0.31** per ticket in the long run.

While the jackpot can be large, the odds are extremely low, so the expected value of purchasing a Powerball ticket is less than the cost of the ticket. This makes the Powerball, like most lotteries, a losing investment in terms of expected value. However, the excitement of the game and the potential for a large win are the main attractions.
