    "**4.002**: So for this question, it askes us to find the units digit of $(1976^{61})(2007^{61})$. So for the $1976^{61}$, $6$ to the power of anything's units digit is still $6$, so it would be $(\\cdots6) \\cdot (2007^{61})$. Next, for the $(2007^{61})$ part, $7$ is the last digit, so $7$'s \"to the power list\" is 7, 9, 3, 1, and 7. So the units digit of $(2007^{61})$ is  $7$. Now the last step is: $7 \\cdot 6$ = $42$, which has a units digit of $2$\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.102**: So the question askes us to find the units digit of $3^{91} + 3^{92} + 3^{93} + 3^{94}$. So since all of those number's base is 3, I made a list of all the **units digits** of powers of $3$:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $3^1$: $3$\n",
    "* $3^2$: $9$\n",
    "* $3^3$: $7$\n",
    "* $3^4$: $1$\n",
    "* $3^5$: $3$\n",
    "\n",
    "So at the fifth number the sequence repeats, so for each of the $3^{91, 92,93, or94}$ I found the units digits:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $3^{91}$: $3$\n",
    "* $3^{92}$: $9$\n",
    "* $3^{93}$: $7$\n",
    "* $3^{94}$: $1$\n",
    "\n",
    "Now I just added all the numbers up: $3+9+7+1$ = $20$. which has a units digit of $0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.212**: Now the next three problems (4.312, 4.412, and 4.512) all ask us to find the decimal form of a fraction. So for this problem, it askes what is $\\frac{71}{999}$. So I know that $\\frac{1}{999}$ = $0.00111\\cdots$, so $\\frac{71}{999}$ = $0.071071071\\cdots$\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.312**: $\\frac{2}{33}$ = $\\frac{6}{99}$ = $0.060606\\cdots$\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.412**: $\\frac{5}{111}$ = $\\frac{45}{999}$ = $0.045045\\cdots$ \n",
    "\n",
    "**4.512**: $\\frac{2}{37}$ = $\\frac{6}{11}$ = $\\frac{54}{999}$ = $0.054054\\cdots$\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.122**: So it askes us to find the 59th digit of the decimal expansion of $\\frac{5}{33}$: $\\frac{5}{33}$ = $\\frac{9}{99}$ = $0.0909\\cdots$, and since all the odd number digits are 0, and all the even number digits are 1, then the 59th digit of the decimal expansion of $\\frac{5}{33}$ = $0$\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.222**: So wqe need to add $0.0707\\cdots$ and $0.00707\\cdots$ together, so I first converted to fractions:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $0.0707\\cdots$ = $\\frac{7}{99}$\n",
    "* $0.00707\\cdots$ = its just $0.0707\\cdots$ times 10: $\\frac{7}{990}$ \n",
    "\n",
    "Then I added those two up: $\\frac{70}{990}$ $+$ $\\frac{7}{990}$ = $\\frac{77}{990}$ = $\\frac{7}{90}$.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.232**: So if they start with Katy, then she will say \"1\". Then Meera also needs to say \"1\", so I found the last place for a person to say \"1\", which was $350 รท 8$ = $43$ with a remainder of $6$. So place 344 would be the last person to say \"8\", so the place 345 would be the last person to say \"1\". And 345 is $6$ places to Katy's right.\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.432**: So I made a list of the first 10 multiples of 31:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $31$: 31, 62, 93, 124, 155, 186, 217, 248, 279, and 300\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "And I found that $248$ was the only number that satisfied this condition. So $248$ is the smallest number that is a multiple of 31 and has a remainder of 1 when divided by 13.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "**4.632**: So I first found all the numbers that was a multiple of 14 + 1 and a multiple of 15 + 2:\n",
    "\n",
    "* $14x +1$: 15, 29, 43, 57, 71, 85, 99, 113, 127, 141, 155, 169, 183, 197, 211, 225, 239, 253, 267, 281, 295, 309, 323, 337, 351, 365, 379, 393, 407\n",
    "* $15x+2$: 17, 32, 47, 62, 77, 92, 107, 122, 137, 152, 167, 182, 197, 212, 227, 242, 257, 272, 287, 302, 317, 332, 347, 362, 377, 392, 407\n",
    "\n",
    "Now the only number that was greater than 200 in these two lists was $407$, so the final answer is $407$.\n",
